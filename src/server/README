I want to create a TCP server that receives commands using RESP protocol for SET/GET

https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/

Requirements:
- Start a TCP/IP service that will listen at port 7900 and will allow SET/GET operations
that will be stored in memory

    SET "hello" "world"
    > OK
    GET "hello"
    > "world"
    GET "invalid"
    > "" ??
